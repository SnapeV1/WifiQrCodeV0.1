## Why I Created This Software

As someone who dislikes navigating through command lines or fiddling with WiFi settings to retrieve and then manually re-enter my WiFi password on various devices, I found the process frustrating and inefficient. This led me to develop **WifiQrCodeV1.0** — a simple solution that automatically generates a QR code containing your WiFi credentials. With this app, you can quickly share your WiFi network with friends and family by just scanning the QR code, saving you time and effort. It's all about making life a little easier and more efficient.
